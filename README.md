## 🎯 Problem Statement
Medical prescriptions are often handwritten, unstructured, and difficult for patients to understand.
- **Context:** Poor handwriting and medical jargon cause misinterpretation and medication errors.
- **Impact:** Patients, pharmacists, and caregivers face safety risks, delays, and confusion.

---

## 💡 Solution
Prescription Analyzer AI leverages **computer vision and NLP** to automatically extract, analyze, and explain prescription data.

1. **AI-Based Text Extraction:** Converts handwritten or scanned prescriptions into machine-readable text.
2. **Medical Entity Analysis:** Identifies medicines, dosage, frequency, and duration using NLP.
3. **Patient-Friendly Output:** Translates complex medical instructions into clear, readable insights.
